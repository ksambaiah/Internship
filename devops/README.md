What is considered to be DevOps? I started as Linux System administrator in a small company in 2000 but did multiple things.

- Setup SMTP servers
- DNS 
- Network security
- Perl programming
- backup etc.
- Training recruits
- Acquire  hardware 
- Backup

When I see now a days talking DevOps does it mean 

- Python
- Cloud 
- CI/CD
- Terraform
- Ansible/Chef
- Network
- Linux and/or Windows Administration
- Kubernets
